Bill of materials
-----------------

R1 to R5 are 150R pull-ups to 5v (as per Beeb circuit diagram).

R6 (2k2), R7 (10k), R9 (330R), R10 (10k) and R11 (2k2) are pull-ups to 3.3v.

R8, R12 and R13 are all 2k2 pull-downs to ground.

J1 is a 34 pin header it should be attached with the notch facing away from the rest of the board.

J2 to J4 are for jumpers to select between 5" and 8" drives and between drive select 0 and 1. But you could hard wire them if you prefer.

J5 is a 40 pin Raspberry Pi header extender.

C1 and C2 are 100nF ceramic disc capacitors for decoupling.

I found I didn't need C3 which was to be a radial capacitor for smoothing power.

The chips are DM7406N open collector inverters. I used chip holders but you don't need to.
An alterative chip if you can't find the DM7406N is the TI SN7406N.
